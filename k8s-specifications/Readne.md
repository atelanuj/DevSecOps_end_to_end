![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f61d7249-d56c-4cbf-91a5-760114dd0452)

- A **front-end web app** in Python which lets you vote between two options
- A **Redis** which collects new votes
- A **.NET worker** which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
- A **Postgres database** backed by a Docker volume
- A Node.js web app which shows the **results** of the voting in real time
